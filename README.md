This is the integration project to deploy the [XDI2](http://github.com/peacekeeper/xdi2) server as an "engine" in [Zephyr](http://github.com/airships/zephyr).

This is work in progress.

### How to build

First, you need to build the main [XDI2](http://github.com/peacekeeper/xdi2) project.

Second, follow the instructions at [Zephyr](http://github.com/airships/zephyr).

You might have to repeat these initial steps frequently, as both XDI2 and Zephyr evolve.

After that, just run

    mvn clean install

To build all components.

### How to run

    mvn jetty:run

Then access the server's status page at

	http://localhost:9990/xdi

Or use an XDI client to send XDI messages to

    http://localhost:9990/xdi/zephyr

### How to build as XDI2 plugin

Run

    mvn clean install package -P xdi2-plugin
